# Weather-Dashboard

# Task

In this Challenge I created a weather Dashboard that recieves user input of the city and state and outputs the current weather and 5 day forecast. Additionally, 5 locations can be saved to the dashboard for ease of access.

New skills utilized in this project are accessing APIs and using bootstrap for formatting.
